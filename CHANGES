pyClanSphere Changelog
======================

This file lists the major changes between the pyClanSphere releases.

pyClanSphere 0.2
----------------

(Codename unknown; not released yet)

- Allow Forms to set csrf_use_source so CSRF is checked for the source path instead of action path
  (Useful for frontend logins)
- Database Schema Versioning to support sane migrations for core and plugins separately using
  sqlalchemy-migrate

board plugin:
- Templates rebased to a layout_board.html
  It inherits layout.html by default yet allows a custom page just for the
  discussion boards as they typically need much space on screen

news plugin:
- merge news_details and _news templates to avoid code duplication

bbcode extension:
- allow ftp urls
- annotate links only if url is given as parameter instead of being within the tag
