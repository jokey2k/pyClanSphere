    pyClanSphere knows now about all the information it needs to setup your
    instance. After you click on the install button pyClanSphere will create
    the database tables and insert the default information. Right after that
    pyClanSphere will be online in maintenance mode which means that it's only
    visible to the administrator, all other users will get a message that
    shows that the site is in maintenance mode right now.
