    pyClanSphere._ext
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This module contains external dependencies that are not installable via
    the cheeseshop, are patched or not worth an extra dependency.

    Why these libraries are here:

    GBXChallengeReader
    ------------------
    Small enough to not put it up as separate package, used to parse Trackmania's
    Challenge Files as war maps. Self-written++

    PostMarkup
    ----------
    Class to sanely render BBCode or Post Markup how the author calls it.
    It's thankyou ware, so please remember to say thank you there :)
    It's just a .py, no module or whatever so just an _ext

    smileys + path
    --------------
    Incorporate smiley parsing from voidspace's guestbook. It's BSD but still
    thanks buddy :)
    Has no other home, so adding it as _ext for now, let's see what happens later on
